# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form

![Design preview for the Interactive card details form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! to my interactive card 

> As it is, this is one of my first challenge from Frontendmentor, involving actual logic.

> And right now am 20% proud of myself, for being able to add logics to a problem. Though it took some couple of months if not a year, to actually get comfortable with JavaScript 🙂. Not the copy and paste type.

> Well within the mean time i adopted some way of making things easier. mostly based on functions and the absence of `semicolons`.

> so as to create more spaghetti 🍝 code 👍, nice for the brain.

> not only that used sasScript so as to have some fun writing css.

> created some utility classes and adopted the ways of some css library (trying to create one too).

> feel free to correct my spaghetti 🍝 code. or if you found my approach interested. just 🌟 the repo. it will make my head swell a little..

> so mf have a nice day love you 😃🍝

```js
// so my code looks like this
